# Understanding Algorithmic Design: learning algorithms through illustrations

Workshop for Formal Methods in Architecture 2024
<br /><br />

## Workshop Description

The workshop will apply pedagogical strategies based on the semi-automatic creation of graphical documentation, e.g., 
illustrations and diagrams, that explain Algorithmic Design (AD) scripts. The aim is to provide participants with a 
learning experience closer to their design thinking, thus smoothing ADâ€™s learning curve. In the first stage, 
participants will be introduced to an AD tool (Khepri), its programming language (Julia), and a semi-automatic
illustration system coupled to this tool. Then, they will learn basic computational concepts and strategies, 
applying them in simple pedagogical examples. Lastly, participants will apply the learnt principles in an interactive,
hands-on session, developing a simple design using the AD tool Khepri and its illustration system.

## Installation
### 1. Installing the Julia programming language
 
First, install Julia: <https://julialang.org/downloads/>

More specifically, use: <https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/winnt/x64/1.11/julia-1.11.1-win64.exe>

We recommend that you accept the default installation options.

In the Select Addition Tasks step, do not forget to select the Add Julia to PATH option. Failing to do so will force you to manually add the path in VScode later on.
<br /><br />
 
### 2. Installing the Visual Studio Code Programming Environment
 
Second, install Visual Studio Code: <https://code.visualstudio.com/>

More specifically, use: <https://code.visualstudio.com/Download#>

Again, we recommend that you accept the default installation options.
<br /><br />

### 3. Installing the Julia and Jupyter Extensions

Third, launch Visual Studio Code and install the Julia and Jupyter extensions.

In Visual Studio Code, click the View menu in the top bar, and choose Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X).

In the extensions pane, type Julia into the search engine (on top) and select the Julia extension by clicking the install button. Visual Studio Code will install it.
Repeat this step for the Jupyter extension.

When the installation completes, restart Visual Studio Code.
<br /><br />


### 4. Installing MikTex

You will also need to install MikTek, which is necessary for creating the illustrations.

To install MikTex use: <https://miktex.org/download>

During the installation process, you can accept the default options. Ensure that the option to install missing packages on the fly is enabled.
Once the installation is complete, restart your computer to ensure all changes take effect.
<br /><br />


### 5. Installing the necessary Julia packages

Lastly, you need some Julia packages to be able to create geometry and its corresponding illustrations, namely
KhepriBase, KhepriTikZ and KhepriIllustrator.

In the **practical** folder, you will find a Jupyter file with the commands you need to run to install all these packages.
